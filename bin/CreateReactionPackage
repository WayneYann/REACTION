# DESCRIPTION
#   This script creates a new working directory tree for package PACKAGE.
#   All required directories and default makefiles are set up.
#
#   The environment variable `Reaction' must be set giving the path to the
#   REACTION root directory.
#
# EXIT CODES
    ERR_ARGS=1 # Error on arguments.
    ERR_ENV=2  # Error on environment.
    ERR_FILE=3 # File error.
#

#
# 1. Basic definitions.
#

This script will create a package working directory in the current directory

	`pwd`

for the package "$PACKAGE", using "$PAC" for the package's namespace.
The author's name is "$NAME".  Are these values correct?
